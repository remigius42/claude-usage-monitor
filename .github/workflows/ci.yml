# Trigger on PRs (any target branch) and pushes to main only.
# This avoids duplicate runs when pushing to a branch with an open PR.
# Workaround: open a draft PR to get CI on branches without a PR yet.
# Note: using concurrency groups to cancel duplicates doesn't work well -
# cancelled jobs clutter the UI and break integrations like CodeRabbit.
